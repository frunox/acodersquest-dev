Today I announced my blog on LinkedIn. I hope I get a more visitors than the 2 or 3 people who have seen it before this.

I put the blog up on my domain several days ago. As expected, there were some things to that needed work before it went public, as discussed in [this post](https://acodersquest.com/post/acq-time-waster-setting-opacity) and [this post](https://acodersquest.com/post/acq-time-waster-setting-opacity). Discussing issues like these are a big part of what the blog is about. My coding skills are still pretty 'beginner-ish', so I don't dispense expert advise, but lessons-learned. I provide links to sources I use to research and correct problems I encounter.

The content focuses mostly on the technologies I'm using now, like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and various databases, along with using Markdown to provide the content. Since the blog is hosted on Firebase, there will be a focus on that platform and it's products, like the Firestore database and Cloud Storage. I plan to move on to a different project soon, so the focus might shift, depending on what resources I end up using.

Another theme in the posts is 'keeping it simple'. There is so much to be learned about coding and web development that it's easy to get lost or overwhelmed. Often, I find content that's too technical for me to fully understand. Sometimes I need a concept laid out step-by-step, starting with the basics. I like simple. Many of the resources I cite present information that way.

I always invite comments, advise and other feedback via my email, shown below. Suggestions for new topics, how to improve my code, and new resources to use are welcome. I'm doing all this on my own and I can use all the help I can get. Hopefully, it will be route to enhanced skills.

I also like to dispense bits of wisdom on occasion, like this:

I hope you enjoy the content and come back often.
